# Software Design

# Flowchart
Continuing with the theme of modularity, our software was written to be expandable to any dimension of Connect-Fourâ„¢ beyond a 6 x 6 design. The code was written in C for Texas Instrument's MSP 430 microcontroller which serves as the brains of the logic operation.

Rough draft of this section
<li>Include TI MSP430 programming compenent (most to be written in hardware)</li>
<li>Include flowcahrt for code </li>
<li>Mention button debouncing fixed through software</li>
<li>Describe hardships with the programming, edge cases, bugs, etc</li>
<li>(include images of a bit of code, perhaps a GIF of a demonstration, and microcontroller itself in action)</li>
