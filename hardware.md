# Hardware Design
Our hardware design starts with the NeoPixel PCBs! Retrofitted with four NeoPixel LEDs, the design for this PCB takes modularity into account. Their function is to illuminate our acrylic panels to serve as "tokens" shining red, green, or blue, indicating the piece that has been dropped onto the EE-Connect arena or when a win condition has been met. Our design serves great emphasis to scalability given its cleverly sleek design to be place on uniform surfaces. Power is delivered from the bottom pins, our data pin at the middle, and ground up top. <More to be added>
