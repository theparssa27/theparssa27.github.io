# Mechanical Design
For the mechanical design of the game board, we decided to use a modular design which involves first designing and testing a single cell. Once the design for one cell is complete, duplicates are created and assembled together to build the full 6x6 game board with 36 total cells. This design is advantageous because it is easy to assemble and resize depending on what dimensions of connect-4 users want to play. Also, the baord can be expanded or shrunken in dimensions to play connect-n. Each cell is a full enclosure with a removable lid that can house the LED PCB, the laser cut acrylic, and metal pins to connect to other cells. Also, each cell has the necessary openings for cell-to-cell wire connections and for users to see the lit up acrylic.
