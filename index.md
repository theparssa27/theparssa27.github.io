# EE-Connect
EE-Connect is a hardware twist on the classic Connect Four™ created by the 2022-23 team of EE-Emerge students at UC Davis. Combining our mechanical, software, and hardware skillsets, we've converted our childhood past-times into a vibrant & fun electronic game, capturing a greater curiousity and intrigue.

# Inspiration
Embarking on the journey to create an electronic version of Connect Four™ was driven by a deep desire to blend nostalgia with innovation. We wanted to preserve the cherished memories of playing this timeless game while applying our engineering acumen towards a project! Our inspiration lies in the belief that by reimagining the beloved and familiar classic, we saw a fantastic opportunity to ignite K-12 student's curiosity in STEM! By immersing them in a fun, captivating electronic board game, we aimed to pique their interest in coding, game design, electronics, and problem-solving.

# Demo
An example game where red wins with a diagonal match!
